So my brother decided to switch from a business course to an IT course. Naturally, my brotherly instinct makes me want to give him the best materials so that he can have a very good knowledge base when he starts the course. Our brief 20 minute of me trying to recall concepts to teach him makes me realize that just like my job, its probably easier to use someone else's materials for the course. Introducing to Harvard's CS50.

CS50 is Harvard's computer science class. Taught by David J. Malan.
