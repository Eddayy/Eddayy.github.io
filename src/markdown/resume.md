**Interest**
---------
I enjoy travelling, reading books, watching movies, going to gym and playing video games on my free time. I have an interest in history and enjoy reading or watching the alternate history genre. Also listen to several podscast like cgpgrey, freakonomics, any gimlet series and 99% invisible. Psycho-physiological economics is a subject that I’m also interested in. Knowing the way people react to decisions and ways to incentivise or decentivise behaviors can help shape
designing economic systems in blockchain.
