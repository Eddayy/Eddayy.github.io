**Interest**
---------
I enjoy traveling, reading books, watching movies, going to gym and playing video games on my free time. I have an interest in history and enjoy reading or watching the alternate history genre. Also listen to several podscast like cgpgrey, freakonomics, any gimlet series and 99% invisible. Psycho-physiological economics is a subject that I’m also interested in. Knowing the way people react to decisions and ways to influence behaviors can help shape
designing economic systems in blockchain. People can change and as a person I am always evolving so my interest and hobbies may change as of the writing of this. (written in May 2018)
