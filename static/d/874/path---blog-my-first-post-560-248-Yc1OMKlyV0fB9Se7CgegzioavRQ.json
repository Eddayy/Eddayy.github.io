{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1>I just started a website</h1>\n<p>Hey! Welcome to the frontpage of me</p>\n<p>For my new year resolution, I wanna start writing more to improve my self expression. For a long time I always struggle with writing, whether its for assignment or work. So I decided to start a blog. I'm gonna try to release a post once a month, maybe push it to a biwwekly basis. I'm gonna write about reviews about shows, intereseting technology and maybe opinionated stuff. For tech related post, its gonna be cross post to my medium article. At the same time, I'm got some features planned for my website like a comment system, recommendations, search functionality and also include more side projects.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First post"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/blog/My-first-post"}}
