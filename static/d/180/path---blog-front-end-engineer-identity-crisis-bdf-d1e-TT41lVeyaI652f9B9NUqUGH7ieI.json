It was talking about <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/\">this</a> article from CSS-trick, \"the great divide\". The main idea is that there is two types of front-end engineers, the UX engineer and the javascript engineer but many companies treat both as the same. </p>\n<p>I think is that it is mainly due to many graduates that came from software engineering backgrounds entering front-end position, they bring their knowledge and approach to programming into their front-end work. Concepts like the SOLID principles are now being applied to front-end development. It turns the website from a design problem into an engineering problem. Don't get me wrong, there nothing wrong with that approach. For many projects, the product manager might think that solving the engineering problems first is better and iteratively improving the design later is a better development flow.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write about where I am coming from podcast>csstrick>developer vs engineer</li>\n<li>Talk about whether everything should be an engineering problem</li>\n<li>Path of front end design vs data management</li>\n<li>Best of both world</li>\n<li>Conflicting interest</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/front-end-engineer-identity-crisis","title":"Front end Engineer identity crisis","date":"09 January 2019","tags":["React"]},"excerpt":"So recently, I listened to a topic about two vastly different approach to front end development on the JS party podcast(great podcast btw you can findâ€¦","timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/blog/front-end-engineer-identity-crisis"}}
