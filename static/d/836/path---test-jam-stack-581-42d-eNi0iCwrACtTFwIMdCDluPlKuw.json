That is what the Jam in the stack stand for. Javascript for dynamic content, APIs that abstract database and Markup for the static content for the website. During the development of this website, I come across this term when looking for cheap and fast design pattern to follow. The Jamstack basically says that there should be no databases, no webserver. You just have to put up the project in git, build it once and let a cdn like github pages or netlify point towards it.</p>\n<p>Previously, web developers uses components and templating engines to improve code reusability and provide dynamic content. The user will go to a link and the server will create the page with dynamic content and serve it to the user. The rendering process used to take a considerable amount of resource as it needs to do thousand of templates. There are ways around it like caching pages, but for small website that was less than a hundred page or when changes to content happen infrequently. </p>\n<p>The JAM stack is a simple pattern as you just have to focus on creating front end of the website. Any dynamic content will be neither generated with markup or fetch from a serverless API. By separating the UI and content, websites are resembling desktop or mobile applications more and more. Where there is only the client application to delivered to the user and they consume the data through the site.</p>\n<p>More and more services are being designed to be achieved through APIs. This evolution is largely thanks to the rise of mobile applications. Mobile developers realize they need a way to deliver dynamic content to their app without a server serving the application. Now you can get largely everything done through an API.</p>\n<p>There are many sites that uses templating engines but should be using </p>\n<p>The core thinking is that as a web developer or a front end developer, </p>\n<p>Recently there have been a push for a new design pattern</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/test/JamStack","title":"JamStack: The Jam between serverless and client","date":"02 January 2019","tags":["Technology",""]},"excerpt":"\nJavascript, API and Markup.
