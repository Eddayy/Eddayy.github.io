{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Hey! Welcome to the frontpage of me.</p>\n<p>For my new year resolution, I wanna start writing more to improve my self expression. For a long time I always struggle with writing, whether its for assignment or work. So I decided to start a blog. I'm gonna commit to release a post once a month, maybe push it to a biweekly basis. I'm gonna write about reviews about shows, intereseting technology and maybe opinionated stuff. For tech related post, its gonna be cross post to my medium article. At the same time, I'm got some features planned for my website like a comment system, recommendations, search functionality,feedback and also include more side projects as well as improving the website design. </p>\n<p>I read somewhere that the optimal length of a post should be around 600 words so thats the target I'll try to reach in search post. There's already a few post ideas I had in mind already. Gonna write about the tech stacks I used for building this website and about my other interest which is machine learning and my journey with udacity's pytorch challenge.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/My-first-post","title":"I just started a website","date":"21 December 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/blog/My-first-post"}}
